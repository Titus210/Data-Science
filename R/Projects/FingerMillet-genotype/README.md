# Finger Millet Genotype Analysis Project

##  Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project focused on analyzing the reactions of finger millet genotypes over time when exposed to water and velum. The primary goal is to understand and characterize the responses of different genotypes under these conditions.

## Project Structure


## Data Analysis
1. Data Collection
- The raw data was cleaned and formatted using R scripts (code/preprocess.R) to ensure consistency.

2. Explanatory Data Analysis(EDA)
  - The code/eda.R script explores the characteristics of the dataset, identifies patterns, and generates visualizations to provide initial insights.

3. Time-Series Analysis
- Utilized time-series analysis techniques (code in code/time_series_analysis.R) to understand how finger millet genotypes react to water and velum over time.

4. Results
The results of the analysis are presented in the results/ directory:
- `results/visualizations/`: Contains plots and charts illustrating the trends and patterns observed during the analysis.
- `results/tables/`: Includes any relevant tables summarizing key findings.

## Achievements
1. `Identification of Reactivity Patterns`: The project successfully identified distinct patterns of reactions among different finger millet genotypes over time when exposed to water and velum.
2. `Insights for Further Research`: The analysis provides valuable insights that can guide further research and experimentation in understanding the factors influencing finger millet genotypes' reactions.
